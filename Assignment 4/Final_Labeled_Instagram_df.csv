Young hyenas are called cubs, and female hyenas are wonderful moms. They take excellent care of their babies, and most hyenas provide their cubs with milk for over one year. This is probably a necessity, as many kills are made far from the den, and hyenas do not bring back food and regurgitate it for their young. At about one year, cubs begin to follow their mothers on their hunting and scavenging forays. Until then, they are left behind at the den with a babysitting adult.

Take a moment and think back to your childhood, the era in your life when the only thing you knew about a bill was that it was a bird’s equivalent of lips, and your day job was to construct fantastical worlds with your favorite toys. In my Toy Stories series, I explore the connection between children and their toys, getting an insight into their tiny worlds and taking you on a trip down memory lane. Toy Stories is the result of a 30-month trip, in which I visited more than 50 countries and took photographs of children and their favorite toys. I would often take part in a child’s games prior to arranging the toys for the photograph. Despite some differences, I found similarities among children living worlds apart. Even in different countries, some children’s toys had the same function for example, protecting them from dangers and things they feared in the night. Toys haven’t changed all that much since I was a kid. I’d often find the kind of toys I used to have.

Just like polar bears, Inuit need the ice in order to travel and hunt. The world is changing, and changing fast.

Many scientifically important fossils have been found here, including the world’s first identified T. rex, in 1902. In the United States, fossils found on private property usually belong to the landowner, and collectors may strike deals with owners to dig on their land.

Who doesn’t know the mythical stories about these large birds bringing babies to new parents? In Ancient Egypt, the stork was associated with the soul. Greek and Roman mythology portrays storks as models of parental devotion. In Chinese wisdom, the stork is a symbol of longevity. In Christianity, the stork is linked with purification, and followers of Islam revered storks because they made an annual ""pilgrimage"" through Mecca on their migration. \nHowever, since the mid-1980s, increasing numbers of white storks have chosen to stay on the European continent all year, rather than migrate to Africa in winter. The reason:  the guaranteed, abundant food supply from landfill sites, like this one in Portugal. While it is clear that the stork population has benefited from the large quantities of food, you don’t have to be a scientist to see something is wrong.\nConfronting the enormous amount of waste we produce on a daily basis is truly horrifying.

Prior to the war, both women used to live in a family house in the suburban village of Opytne, between Donetsk and Avdeevka, in eastern Ukraine. They had to flee when their street became a front line—a powerful explosion buried Lira alive under the wreckage. Altogether the house got three direct artillery hits.\nNow they live in Tatiana’s daughter’s apartment in Avdeevka. This apartment was also damaged by shelling and repaired by the women on their own. “My daughter has a real talent! She has fixed it so nicely you could never tell there was a huge hole in this wall,” she proudly tells us. Her husband, Aleksander, chose to rebel against the war’s indignity in his own way: like many people in eastern Ukraine, he refuses to leave his demolished house. He continues living in the basement–the only surviving part–and cultivates the garden. Every day he takes a bike ride through the minefield that separates Opytnoe from Avdeevka to visit his wife. Tatiana prepares him a meal to take back, as he has no kitchen left in the ruins.\nTatiana lost a court hearing over compensation for her house. She felt humiliated by the attitude of the hearing members: “They would ask me questions like, why do I think that my house was shelled? Then they turned to a witness and began interrogating her about what brand of refrigerator I had and how many burners there were on the gas stove. They were talking to us like they assumed we were lying and it was their job to catch us out.” Ukraine’s official position is that Russia is to blame for the war, and so all claims should be addressed across the border. \nWords by Alisa Sopova, from the series #5Kfromthefrontline, an ongoing project about the everyday consequences of the war in eastern Ukraine.",280839,1762,"['Eating', 'Human', 'Food', 'Meal', 'Dish', 'Child', 'Comfort food', 'Conversation', 'Cuisine']"

Makos are one of the fastest fish in the sea, capable of bursts up to 60mph.  Of all shark species, they have one of the largest brains, relative to body size. They are also an endothermic shark, meaning that they can generate heat within their bodies. This allows them to swim into cooler waters to feed on oily fish, giving them great strength and fueling their powerful muscles. The numbers of makos have declined worldwide due to over fishing and the demand for shark fins.

At high tide, the tidal pools churned with endless swirls of microplastics—bits and pieces of single-use bottles, cups, and containers—that made their way here to America’s island paradise from around the world. Thanks to volunteers who have removed over 275 tons of plastic waste from this coastline, it looks cleaner than it did a few years ago. The giant bottles and crates are gone. But when you look closer, you quickly realize the entire shore is a matrix of lava, sand, and microplastics. And it will keep coming until we as consumers and business leaders start to change our dependence on single-use plastic. Today, only 9 percent of single-use containers get recycled. The rest of it ends up in rivers, seas, and eventually even paradisiacal beaches like this one. #planetorplastic // @BritaUSA believes everyone deserves cleaner, great-tasting water without the waste of bottles.

It shows a female Florida panther with two cubs skirting the edge of a cypress swamp on Babcock Ranch State Preserve. She is the first female panther documented north of Caloosahatchee River since 1973. Biologists from the Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission got the first photos of her in November 2016, and allowed me to set up a camera trap nearby. I got my first photo of the mother in January 2017. When I showed it to David Shindle, head panther biologist for the US Fish & Wildlife Service, he said, ""I\'ve been dreaming about her for 18 years."" I captured this photo with cubs a year later. For 44 years, the breading population of Florida panther—the last puma surviving in the east—had been isolated to the southern tip of Florida. The species will never reach sustainable numbers without access to its historic territory in the northern Everglades and beyond. Just as this female panther gives new hope, a new toll road threatens to cut through and develop the last wild places that panthers need.

There are many. While we try not to anthropomorphize animals, there are individuals whose determination, dedication, and apparent kindness—even in the face of dire circumstances—speak volumes. One such female is a lioness in the Okavango known as Fekeetsa, a name that translates to ""overpower"" or ""overcome"" because of the odds that she faced. \nPerhaps she resonates particularly with me because I spent so much time with her after Dereck Joubert and I had been badly injured by a buffalo. We learnt her story after months of our own recovery and my close call with death. Fekeetsa was left with a broken wrist after a buffalo hunt went wrong. It should have been a death sentence, but she had young cubs to feed and she wasn\'t going to give up on them. \nDespite undeniable pain, she changed her hunting strategy and searched the swamps for baby lechwe hidden in the reeds so she wouldn\'t have to chase them. Every day she went out with the excruciating injury, and every day she brought food back for her cubs, who grew stronger and bigger. Gradually she began to heal, although she will always limp. At the beginning of this year she even adopted a cub that had strayed from its own pride and gotten lost—a phenomenon that is unheard of among lions. \nToday Fekeetsa\'s cubs are nearing her size and she has recovered enough to broaden her hunts again. She has shown a spirit that I have seen in many women over the years—a knowledge that the responsibility lies with her and the complete refusal to accept failure.\n#Fekeetsa #ThisismyTrophy\n\nNat Geo is celebrating women who fearlessly push boundaries and inspire the next generation of changemakers.

Tradition dictates that during the journey she must not look back. A Samburu legend tells of a young bride who was about to leave her family’s house. Her father gave precise instructions, including not to look back, but the girl was so sad she could not resist a last glance at the home where she had grown up. During the night, the god Nkai, furious with the disobedient girl, decided to punish her. Her body began to swell until it broke through the hut roof, finally turning into a majestic elephant. The Samburu believe that all elephants descend from this girl, and that elephants and the Samburu have blood ties. It's believed that if elephants find a dead man, they place bundles of grass or branches on his grave, and similarly if a Samburu finds a dead elephant, he takes a bundle of green grass, spits on it, and rolls it inside the skull cavity. It's considered a sign of respect and a blessing: the grass is a symbol of peace, and the spit equates to rain, a divine gift in this arid region. It’s traditions like this that we must take time to learn and understand their significance. It’s vital that as we engage with communities, we understand their beliefs. \nIn my experience, allowing these communities to share in the financial benefits generated by the presence of wildlife on their lands is key if we are to succeed at all in conserving the planet's wildlife and ecosystems.

The silhouette of an oceanic whitetip shark creates a stark shape against the blue water and sky in The Bahamas.

I’ve known this panther, through my camera traps, for nearly three years. I’ve seen him heal from battle scars, recover from a limp, and persistently court the first female panther documented north of the Caloosahatchee River since 1973. I also have seen kittens that were probably his. I’ve never seen a panther in this part of Florida with my own eyes. Only through tracks and photos do I get a glimpse into its secretive life. Knowing this dominant male panther is patrolling and defending his territory gives me hope that we can use his story to defend the larger territory of his species from the expanded roads and development that currently target Florida’s last wild places. Rancher Cary Lightsey told me: “The panther is going to have to help us save Florida.” I believe his words the panther can help inspire a movement to achieve balance for wild Florida and ourselves.

Urchins, in turn, feed on kelp, so their overabundance led to what we now call “urchin barrens,” regions with hardly any kelp at all. As sea otters return to these waters, they bring sea urchin numbers down and urchin barrens have a chance to become kelp forests again.\nThis slender algae has small gas chambers—like panes in a window—that keep it afloat.

As with most people who love the natural environment, I had inhaled a whole creed that shaped how I saw things. Nature was some place not inhabited by human beings, I would tell myself. Nature is “out there” the great conservationist John Muir regularly used that phrase. Nature is an “other.” It is every place where people are not. This yarn comes to us from stories people have been telling themselves for so long that no one seems to know where, why, and how it originated. Over the course of 40 years as an environmental photographer, though, I’ve realized that things are a lot more complicated than that. Humans and nature are constantly colliding there is no boundary between the two. Yet we still like to believe that we can separate ourselves from, and even control, nature.

Sometimes I take for granted the things I know—and I fail to explain them to those that might be seeing an animal for the first time! What we see here are four humpback whales feeding together. Their mouths are open and their throat pleats distended to accommodate the large volume of water they must displace in order to filter fish and krill through their baleen. It is an incredible spectacle to watch when these large animals emerge from the water with such force. I can only imagine what goes on underwater, but it must be amazing. Humpback whales were almost completely wiped out by whaling. They made a fabulous comeback when they received protection by mechanisms such as the Endangered Species Act, a crucial piece of legislation that has recently become endangered itself.

Hank Brackenberry was buckaroo boss for the IL ranch in northeast Nevada when I met him in 1979. The IL was one of the few ranches to still run a chuck wagon that moved with the buckaroos as they covered the vast high desert range gathering cattle. Hank was all of 21 years of age at that time. He had a wry sense of humor and, as with many of the young men, a taste for whiskey and the occasional night on the town, which might be Elko. I was on my own at this point, working just for myself, hoping to gather my best pictures and writing into a book which became ""Vanishing Breed, Photographs of the American West and the Cowboy,"" published by New York Graphics Books/Little Brown Co., in 1982.  The book was awarded the Best Western Art book by the National Cowboy Hall of Fame and Western Heritage Center, the first time the award was given to a photographer rather than a painter. It is the one award given to me over my career that I cherish the most.\nFor more images of the American West and other assignments spanning a five-decade career, follow me @williamalbertallard.\n#cowboys #nevada #elko #filmphotography",173599,686,"['Sitting', 'Human', 'Smile']"

The villagers of Sanjou live on the edge of Pendjari National Park, and they are permitted to engage in this fishing festival for only three days every three years. All the villagers bring nets and baskets, and within moments it’s a mud-soaked frenzy, with over 3,000 people in the water. Fishing camps are banned within the park and in border areas, as they often become poaching camps. Fish populations also desperately need\nto recover from unrelenting commercial operations. The park employs locals for all its work as a means of compensation, and there seems to be understanding as a result. Pendjari anchors the transnational West-Arly–Pendjari reserve, which covers 35,000 square kilometers. This is the largest remaining intact ecosystem in West Africa and is still in a state of mismanagement. The nonprofit African Parks hopes to resolve that by initially addressing Pendjari while working alongside the government of Benin, which has invited the group in.

Turtles have roamed the Earth for more than 200 million years but struggle to adapt to today’s rapidly changing environment, caused by habitat destruction, human consumption, the pet trade, and climate change. Like this southern river terrapin @accb_cambodia, more than half of the Earth’s 360 turtle and tortoise species are on the brink of extinction. This species is among the 25 most endangered freshwater turtle and tortoise species of the world and is the national reptile of Cambodia. Referred to as the “royal turtle,” this iconic species is already extinct in Singapore and likely Vietnam, with only small populations surviving in a few river systems in Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The Angkor Centre for Conservation of Biodiversity, Allwetterzoo Münster, the Wildlife Conservation Society, and Cambodia’s fisheries administration are jointly working to protect the royal turtle by protecting their last remaining habitats, maintaining ""captive assurance"" colonies, conducting research, and raising awareness of this iconic species.

But more surprising is the fainter glow behind me (swipe). This is Los Angeles, still visible from 170 miles away (275 km). Light pollution is a story that many of us are dealing with, but few are talking about it. It's not just about the vanishing beauty of stars. This is a massive waste of energy, sending undirected and unshielded light to the sky. It's about the environmental impact on birds, insects, and many other species, including us.

In a sparse and difficult land where dry season temperatures reach nearly 50°C (120°F) in the shade, the relationship between people and nature is stripped down to its bare essentials. When the absolute daily need for water is not disguised by an urban or suburban life far from an anonymous water source, it’s easy to see how people and wildlife share common fates tied to the immediate availability or absence of nature’s most essential gifts. Over the centuries, the nomadic Tuareg people watched the wild herds of elephants to know when it was time to migrate because rains had begun in distant foraging grounds. This man, Elmehdi, was an elephant conservation ranger back in 2005 when I was working in Mali with @wildfoundation and @savetheelephants to document a remnant elephant herd that is the northernmost one in Africa and makes the longest annual migration. Following Mali’s elephants through the Sahel helped me understand how much habitat large animals need to survive and how intimately connected all life is. These lessons stayed with me when I started the foundations of the Florida Wildlife Corridor project at home the following year.

This is the only art course in the U.S. in which students get to see a dissection and draw on the spot. It is not uncommon for Drexel medical students (colored scrubs) or their professors to be present and interact with the art students (white scrubs), as seen here. Leonardo da Vinci was a pioneer in the study of the human body. Intent on exploring and explaining every aspect of anatomy and physiology, he performed over 30 dissections of human cadavers and many more of animals. He is also among the greatest draftsmen ever to have lived, and his studies of skeletons, musculature, and other visible structures remain to this day largely unsurpassed in their beauty. #leonardo #davinci #leonardodavinci #art #drawing",331186,2307,"['Science', 'Medical assistant', 'Research']"
