Tapirs are South America’s largest land mammal and have existed since the Eocene era. They are known as the gardeners of the forest, responsible for shaping and maintaining biodiversity. They are herbivores, with roughly 50 percent of their diet consisting of fruit, and are also wide-ranging animals, traveling long distances across different habitats. So after they consume and digest their fruits, they spread seeds all over the forest.

I took this photograph of this cub greeting its mother in Mombo Camp in the Okavango Delta, Botswana. Even though hyenas look a lot like dogs, in fact they are more closely related to cats. Young hyenas are called cubs, and female hyenas are wonderful moms. They take excellent care of their babies, and most hyenas provide their cubs with milk for over one year. This is probably a necessity, as many kills are made far from the den, and hyenas do not bring back food and regurgitate it for their young. At about one year, cubs begin to follow their mothers on their hunting and scavenging forays. Until then, they are left behind at the den with a babysitting adult.

Living in the pelagic zone (open ocean), oceanic whitetips are shaped like aircrafts, with long pectoral fins that allow them to glide efficiently over long distances, expending little energy. \nIn 2006, I led a trip to Cat Island in The Bahamas, where we discovered a population of this species in one of the few locations left where these animals predictably can be found. Oceanic whitetip populations have been decimated due to the demand for their fins, which are prized for shark fin soup. Like the American bison, an animal that was once abundant and then hunted to the brink, only a fraction of oceanic whitetip shark populations remains today. Their numbers declined 93% between 1995 and 2010. Recovery will be difficult, because they reach sexual maturity by age seven and have small litters of pups every one to two years.

Take a moment and think back to your childhood, the era in your life when the only thing you knew about a bill was that it was a bird’s equivalent of lips, and your day job was to construct fantastical worlds with your favorite toys. In my Toy Stories series, I explore the connection between children and their toys, getting an insight into their tiny worlds and taking you on a trip down memory lane. Toy Stories is the result of a 30-month trip, in which I visited more than 50 countries and took photographs of children and their favorite toys. I would often take part in a child’s games prior to arranging the toys for the photograph. Despite some differences, I found similarities among children living worlds apart. Even in different countries, some children’s toys had the same function for example, protecting them from dangers and things they feared in the night. Toys haven’t changed all that much since I was a kid. I’d often find the kind of toys I used to have.

Hunters across the Arctic today suffer the opposite fate: the sea ice is rapidly disappearing. Climate change threatens thousands of years of tradition. Just like polar bears, Inuit need the ice in order to travel and hunt. The world is changing, and changing fast.

A bite from Jameson's mamba can be deadly in as little as 30 to 120 minutes without proper medical treatment. Ironically it is the lethal characteristics of snake venom that make it so valuable and sought after for use in medicinal treatments. The toxic components of snake venom have, for example, led to the development of medicine for heart disease, diabetes, and Alzheimer's.

The layers of fossil-rich rock date to the end of the Cretaceous period and contain a valuable record of the world just before the dinosaurs became extinct. Many scientifically important fossils have been found here, including the world’s first identified T. rex, in 1902. In the United States, fossils found on private property usually belong to the landowner, and collectors may strike deals with owners to dig on their land.

Perhaps that’s why I feel such empathy for the struggles of mothers in the wild. A harp seal mother does everything by herself. She gives birth on the ice where her pup will spend the first weeks of his life, suckling at her side until he is ready, around two weeks later, to slip over the lip of the ice and into the Arctic water. These pups are born without blubber, but they quickly pack it on from their mother's milk, which contains between 25% and 40% fat—the higher the fat content, the closer the pups are to leaving their mother's side.

It is one of only three places where rock salt is commercially mined in the U.K., the others being in North Yorkshire and Northern Ireland. Rock salt extraction began at Winsford in the 17th century. Initially it was used as salt licks for animals and to strengthen weak brine. In 1844 Winsford Rock Salt Mine was opened, and is claimed by its operator, Salt Union Ltd., to be Britain's oldest working mine. Seen here is Avenue One, a main roadway through the vast mine.

Who doesn’t know the mythical stories about these large birds bringing babies to new parents? In Ancient Egypt, the stork was associated with the soul. Greek and Roman mythology portrays storks as models of parental devotion. In Chinese wisdom, the stork is a symbol of longevity. In Christianity, the stork is linked with purification, and followers of Islam revered storks because they made an annual ""pilgrimage"" through Mecca on their migration. \nHowever, since the mid-1980s, increasing numbers of white storks have chosen to stay on the European continent all year, rather than migrate to Africa in winter. The reason:  the guaranteed, abundant food supply from landfill sites, like this one in Portugal. While it is clear that the stork population has benefited from the large quantities of food, you don’t have to be a scientist to see something is wrong.\nConfronting the enormous amount of waste we produce on a daily basis is truly horrifying.

Prior to the war, both women used to live in a family house in the suburban village of Opytne, between Donetsk and Avdeevka, in eastern Ukraine. They had to flee when their street became a front line—a powerful explosion buried Lira alive under the wreckage. Altogether the house got three direct artillery hits.\nNow they live in Tatiana’s daughter’s apartment in Avdeevka. This apartment was also damaged by shelling and repaired by the women on their own. “My daughter has a real talent! She has fixed it so nicely you could never tell there was a huge hole in this wall,” she proudly tells us. Her husband, Aleksander, chose to rebel against the war’s indignity in his own way: like many people in eastern Ukraine, he refuses to leave his demolished house. He continues living in the basement–the only surviving part–and cultivates the garden. Every day he takes a bike ride through the minefield that separates Opytnoe from Avdeevka to visit his wife. Tatiana prepares him a meal to take back, as he has no kitchen left in the ruins.\nTatiana lost a court hearing over compensation for her house. She felt humiliated by the attitude of the hearing members: “They would ask me questions like, why do I think that my house was shelled? Then they turned to a witness and began interrogating her about what brand of refrigerator I had and how many burners there were on the gas stove. They were talking to us like they assumed we were lying and it was their job to catch us out.” Ukraine’s official position is that Russia is to blame for the war, and so all claims should be addressed across the border. \nWords by Alisa Sopova, from the series #5Kfromthefrontline, an ongoing project about the everyday consequences of the war in eastern Ukraine.",280839,1762

Snake rescuer Joy Mascarenhas safely rescued this snake and later released it into a designated forested area. Mascarenhas told me he had now rescued over 150 king cobras. While snakes being removed and rescued is certainly better than them being killed, recent studies suggest many species of snake die if they are moved too far from where they were originally living—and this is especially true with a species as large and intelligent as the king cobra. Dedicated snake lovers and researchers across India are already beginning to address this concern by convincing locals to let the snake remain in the general vicinity.

I had never seen a sperm whale breach like this before. Compared to orcas or humpback whales, sperm whales aren't as well known for this kind of aerobatic display, but here you can see that they are capable of great agility. They are the largest toothed predators in the world with the largest brains, and their skeletons are designed to handle the immense pressure of their deep ocean dives. A flexible cartilage connects the spine to the ribs, which means the rib cage collapses under heavy pressure instead of snapping. These whales were historically hunted for their oil and spermaceti, a mixture of fat and waxes found in their heads. Spermaceti was used to make candles and cosmetics, among other things. The outlaw of most whaling worldwide has granted these whales some protection, but they are still considered vulnerable and endangered, and there is more that we can do for them.

You could be a wildlife photographer for twenty years and never be prepared for what it\'s like to walk up to a dying sea otter, wheezing its last breaths. Beginning in 2013, a body of warm water, nicknamed ""the blob,"" formed in the Gulf of Alaska. It morphed and it grew and it stretched all the way to Mexico, until it covered 3.5 million square miles, feeding toxic algae blooms that devastated marine life on the North Pacific coast for years. In 2015, some 300 sea otters were found dead or dying on beaches in Homer, Alaska. I will never forget the sounds they made. Warming water temperatures worldwide are a symptom of the climate crisis—the blob was like a fever. The American government recently announced that it intends to change the Endangered Species Act, making it easier to remove endangered species, like the sea otter, from the list. It also pits the value of protecting species up against the cost of losing revenue from industry. Research tells us that extreme events like the blob will become more common if we continue to put industry and profit first, things will only get worse.

Take a moment and think back to your childhood, the era in your life when the only thing you knew about a bill was that it was a bird’s equivalent of lips, and your day job was to construct fantastical worlds with your favorite toys. In my Toy Stories series, I explore the connection between children and their toys, getting an insight into their tiny worlds and taking you on a trip down memory lane. Toy Stories is the result of a 30-month trip in which I visited more than 50 countries and took photographs of children and their favorite toys. I would often take part in a child’s games prior to arranging the toys for the photograph. Despite some differences, I found similarities among children living worlds apart. Even in different countries, some children’s toys had the same function for example, protecting them from dangers and things they feared in the night. Toys haven’t changed all that much since I was a kid. I’d often find the kind of toys I used to have. It was nice to go back to my childhood somehow. | Follow me @gabrielegalimbertiphoto for more photos and stories #toys #play #kids #child #children",306492,1331

As a consequence of its isolation, the island is home to a high number of endemic species up to a third of its plant life is endemic. It has been described as the ""most alien-looking place on Earth.” In the 1990s, a team of United Nations biologists conducted a survey of the archipelago’s flora and fauna and counted nearly 700 species found nowhere else only New Zealand, Hawaii, New Caledonia, and the Galápagos Islands have more impressive numbers. \nIn the foreground, the Socotra desert rose, or bottle tree, can be seen—one of the island\'s endemic plants.

There are many. While we try not to anthropomorphize animals, there are individuals whose determination, dedication, and apparent kindness—even in the face of dire circumstances—speak volumes. One such female is a lioness in the Okavango known as Fekeetsa, a name that translates to ""overpower"" or ""overcome"" because of the odds that she faced. \nPerhaps she resonates particularly with me because I spent so much time with her after Dereck Joubert and I had been badly injured by a buffalo. We learnt her story after months of our own recovery and my close call with death. Fekeetsa was left with a broken wrist after a buffalo hunt went wrong. It should have been a death sentence, but she had young cubs to feed and she wasn\'t going to give up on them. \nDespite undeniable pain, she changed her hunting strategy and searched the swamps for baby lechwe hidden in the reeds so she wouldn\'t have to chase them. Every day she went out with the excruciating injury, and every day she brought food back for her cubs, who grew stronger and bigger. Gradually she began to heal, although she will always limp. At the beginning of this year she even adopted a cub that had strayed from its own pride and gotten lost—a phenomenon that is unheard of among lions. \nToday Fekeetsa\'s cubs are nearing her size and she has recovered enough to broaden her hunts again. She has shown a spirit that I have seen in many women over the years—a knowledge that the responsibility lies with her and the complete refusal to accept failure.\n#Fekeetsa #ThisismyTrophy\n\nNat Geo is celebrating women who fearlessly push boundaries and inspire the next generation of changemakers.

Her father gave precise instructions, including not to look back, but the girl was so sad she could not resist a last glance at the home where she had grown up. During the night, the god Nkai, furious with the disobedient girl, decided to punish her. Her body began to swell until it broke through the hut roof, finally turning into a majestic elephant. The Samburu believe that all elephants descend from this girl, and that elephants and the Samburu have blood ties. It's believed that if elephants find a dead man, they place bundles of grass or branches on his grave, and similarly if a Samburu finds a dead elephant, he takes a bundle of green grass, spits on it, and rolls it inside the skull cavity. It's considered a sign of respect and a blessing: the grass is a symbol of peace, and the spit equates to rain, a divine gift in this arid region. It’s traditions like this that we must take time to learn and understand their significance. It’s vital that as we engage with communities, we understand their beliefs. \nIn my experience, allowing these communities to share in the financial benefits generated by the presence of wildlife on their lands is key if we are to succeed at all in conserving the planet's wildlife and ecosystems.

However, this is not the first time this community has had to relocate. Before 1949, the villagers of Newtok and their ancestors lived a mostly nonsedentary way of life. In 1949 the Bureau for Indian Affairs (BIA) was required to build schools in all Alaska native communities after decades of forcing children to attend boarding schools. The BIA chose the site that is now Newtok without input from its future residents. The locations for Newtok and other new permanent villages across Alaska in the 1950s and '60s were chosen for their accessibility to barges for transporting building materials. As early as 1994, the people of Newtok began planning to relocate once again, due to erosion and flooding, and the situation has become urgent as a result of climate change and thawing permafrost.

I’ve seen him heal from battle scars, recover from a limp, and persistently court the first female panther documented north of the Caloosahatchee River since 1973. I also have seen kittens that were probably his. I’ve never seen a panther in this part of Florida with my own eyes. Only through tracks and photos do I get a glimpse into its secretive life. Knowing this dominant male panther is patrolling and defending his territory gives me hope that we can use his story to defend the larger territory of his species from the expanded roads and development that currently target Florida’s last wild places. Rancher Cary Lightsey told me: “The panther is going to have to help us save Florida.” I believe his words the panther can help inspire a movement to achieve balance for wild Florida and ourselves.

Urchins, in turn, feed on kelp, so their overabundance led to what we now call “urchin barrens,” regions with hardly any kelp at all.

Within a week his assistant, George Viccars, was dead, and more began dying in the household soon after. As the disease spread, the villagers turned for leadership to their rector, the Rev. William Mompesson, and Puritan minister Thomas Stanley.

As with most people who love the natural environment, I had inhaled a whole creed that shaped how I saw things. Nature was some place not inhabited by human beings, I would tell myself. Nature is “out there” the great conservationist John Muir regularly used that phrase. Nature is an “other.” It is every place where people are not. This yarn comes to us from stories people have been telling themselves for so long that no one seems to know where, why, and how it originated. Over the course of 40 years as an environmental photographer, though, I’ve realized that things are a lot more complicated than that.

It's good news for these big cats because the buffalo move seasonally (and are a much more dangerous prey). But the smaller size of these antelope means that the lions need to hunt more often. Dominant male lions (being male lions) will take advantage of the lionesses' kills, if possible, rather than expend energy hunting for themselves. How do they know when a kill happens? Often it is by following vultures, whose sudden flocks are quick giveaway of a possible meal.

The young are born and nursed inside complex dens, which provide shelter and protection against predators. After three weeks, the young start leaving the den to explore the surroundings—and luckily I arrived just as six little fur balls had emerged from the den. They spent 30 minutes playing in the midnight sun before they started to get sleepy again and headed back to their den. \nUpon my return to the Netherlands I entered the images in a photography competition, and to my surprise I was the overall winner.

Researchers believe that these important migratory routes are somehow genetically encoded and are working to discover the mechanisms behind it. But this does show us how much we don’t know, and how important historical migratory routes are. This World Environment Day it is certainly worthwhile assessing other fences and the impact (positive or negative) that they may be having.

At first glance this moment might seem cute, but there is a both an irony and a dark history here: These pots were used to boil the fat off of elephant seals, a pinniped like this fur seal, in the early 20th century, only a hundred years ago. Elephant seals were hunted for their body fat, and fur seals were nearly wiped out for their fur. When the killing eventually stopped, fur seals rebounded to their historic numbers, and today elephant seal populations are also healthy and thriving.

The villagers of Sanjou live on the edge of Pendjari National Park, and they are permitted to engage in this fishing festival for only three days every three years. All the villagers bring nets and baskets, and within moments it’s a mud-soaked frenzy, with over 3,000 people in the water. Fishing camps are banned within the park and in border areas, as they often become poaching camps. Fish populations also desperately need\nto recover from unrelenting commercial operations. The park employs locals for all its work as a means of compensation, and there seems to be understanding as a result. Pendjari anchors the transnational West-Arly–Pendjari reserve, which covers 35,000 square kilometers. This is the largest remaining intact ecosystem in West Africa and is still in a state of mismanagement. The nonprofit African Parks hopes to resolve that by initially addressing Pendjari while working alongside the government of Benin, which has invited the group in.

There are more than 50 caves on Socotra, but Hoq cave, located on the northeast side of the island, is perhaps the biggest and most well known. Since being ""discovered"" by the Socotra Karst Project in 2000, a range of Indian, South Arabian, Ethiopian, Greek, and Bactrian inscriptions have been found here, along with images dating from the first century B.C.E. to the sixth century C.E. In addition, several incense burners, shells, torches, pottery fragments, and a wooden tablet inscribed in Palmyra have also been found.

Menstruation is a taboo topic in poor South African communities, and girls often start menstruating with little information about what’s happening, leading to fear and a lack of knowledge about how to safely manage their cycles. Teachers in South Africa say they do not always feel it is their role to teach girls about menstruation, nor do they have the skills to do so. The cost of period products proves to be a hindrance for many girls in poor communities, but citizens are trying to overcome that obstacle.

Turtles have roamed the Earth for more than 200 million years but struggle to adapt to today’s rapidly changing environment, caused by habitat destruction, human consumption, the pet trade, and climate change. Like this southern river terrapin @accb_cambodia, more than half of the Earth’s 360 turtle and tortoise species are on the brink of extinction. This species is among the 25 most endangered freshwater turtle and tortoise species of the world and is the national reptile of Cambodia. Referred to as the “royal turtle,” this iconic species is already extinct in Singapore and likely Vietnam, with only small populations surviving in a few river systems in Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The Angkor Centre for Conservation of Biodiversity, Allwetterzoo Münster, the Wildlife Conservation Society, and Cambodia’s fisheries administration are jointly working to protect the royal turtle by protecting their last remaining habitats, maintaining ""captive assurance"" colonies, conducting research, and raising awareness of this iconic species. If you like turtles and would like to contribute to conservation efforts, share this post with your friends and turtles lovers and join us to celebrate World Turtle Day!

I just returned from a trip to Switzerland with Klaus Thymann of @projectpressure to photograph the Rhône Glacier, which is disappearing at a colossal rate. A small shop there carves an ice grotto in the glacier and charges tourists for the experience of stepping into the blue ice—so it's been worth their money to attempt to slow the glacier’s retreat. They've invested heavily in a special thermal blanket that has kept about 25 meters (82 feet of depth) of ice from disappearing, keeping  the ice grotto intact. However, after a few harsh winters on the mountain, the blanket is starting to disintegrate. And unfortunately the method is not scaleable: we can't do this to all the world’s ice. The gesture is as forlorn and doomed as the glacier itself. So with heavy lament, we now know that this glacier, which has existed for millennia, will disappear within the lifetime of children born today. This image is part of a series dedicated to raising environmental awareness through photography.

It’s taken me to Canada to talk to survivors of Indian residential schools that operated until 1996 and to Australia to interview members of the Stolen Generations who were taken from their mothers in the 1970s, as well as to about 25 communities in the U.S.—where we have had virtually no government-led efforts to address our own continuing history with cultural genocide. I spent the month of March in Hawaii and found many of the same stories there—language bans in the public school system, suppression of cultural practices, creating shame in young children over their ethnic identity—but also a fierce multigenerational movement to push back against colonial educational practices and build Hawaiian-led school systems. Pele, the remarkable woman in this photo, grew up like most Hawaiians her age: not speaking Hawaiian at home. There was a point in the 1980s in which there were fewer than 50 fluent speakers under the age of 18. So Pele and her husband learned Hawaiian when they went to college, and are now raising three children who speak Hawaiian as their first language.

In a sparse and difficult land where dry season temperatures reach nearly 50°C (120°F) in the shade, the relationship between people and nature is stripped down to its bare essentials. When the absolute daily need for water is not disguised by an urban or suburban life far from an anonymous water source, it’s easy to see how people and wildlife share common fates tied to the immediate availability or absence of nature’s most essential gifts. Over the centuries, the nomadic Tuareg people watched the wild herds of elephants to know when it was time to migrate because rains had begun in distant foraging grounds. This man, Elmehdi, was an elephant conservation ranger back in 2005 when I was working in Mali with @wildfoundation and @savetheelephants to document a remnant elephant herd that is the northernmost one in Africa and makes the longest annual migration. Following Mali’s elephants through the Sahel helped me understand how much habitat large animals need to survive and how intimately connected all life is.

Today I’m in Liwonde National Park, Malawi an important stop on our official tour of southern Africa, planting trees for the Queens Commonwealth Canopy. As part of this takeover, I am inviting you to be a part of our ‘Looking Up’ social campaign. To help launch the campaign, here is a photograph I took today here in Liwonde of Baobab trees. “#LookingUp seeks to raise awareness of the vital role trees play in the Earth’s ecosystem, and is an opportunity for all of us to take a moment, to appreciate the beauty of our surroundings. So, join us today and share your own view, by looking up! Post images of the trees in your local community using the hashtag #LookingUp. I will be posting my favourite images from @NatGeo photographers here throughout the day, and over on @sussexroyal I will be sharing some of my favourite images from everything you post. I can’t wait to see what you see when you’re #LookingUp 🌲 🌳” ••• His Royal Highness is currently on an official tour to further the Queens Commonwealth Canopy, which was launched in 2015. Commonwealth countries have been invited to submit forests and national parks to be protected and preserved as well as to plant trees. The Duke has helped QCC projects in the Caribbean, U.K., New Zealand, Australia, Botswana, Malawi, and Tonga. Now, almost 50 countries are taking part and have dedicated indigenous forests for conservation and committed to planting millions of new trees to help combat climate change.\n\nThe Duke’s longtime passion for trees and forests as nature’s simple solution to the environmental issues we face has been inspired by the work he has been doing on behalf of his grandmother, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, for many years.",495460,1771

He was photographed in the orb that caps the dome during a routine checkup visit. The dome was designed by Brunelleschi. The orb, or the “palla” as it is known in Italy, is a copper hollow sphere—gilded in gold, 2.30 meters in diameter and weighing more than 18 tons—placed atop the dome. It was constructed by the workshop of Verrocchio in 1469, and Leonardo da Vinci, an apprentice of Verrocchio at the time, actively worked at designing and constructing the orb. According to Vasari, the orb “required much care and ingenuity, to make it possible to enter the ball from below, and make it proof against damage from the wind”. Later in life Leonardo recalled the construction, in a note from around 1515: “Remember the solders used for soldering the ball on Santa Maria del Fiore in ’69.” This was a time when he was involved in a scheme to manufacture parabolic mirrors, made of a number of facets soldered together. #leonardo #leonardodavinci #firenze #italy #florence",415856,1215

To test this theory, they created Pleistocene Park, a site along a tributary of the Kolyma River that is home to imported wild horses, like the ones seen here, as well other animals like bison, yaks and moose. \nArctic permafrost is thawing much faster than expected, releasing carbon gases that could drastically speed up climate change. As a result, climate scientists—permafrost experts, in particular—say all signs point to the need for urgent and audacious action. As writer @craigwelch asks in our recently published @natgeo article (link in my bio), “Is trying to save permafrost by restoring the Arctic steppe really so much crazier than counting on humans to quickly retool the world’s energy system? Maybe we need a little craziness.”",698190,2196

Hopefully this will give giraffes a bit more of a break while we tackle the other issues surrounding habitat degradation and their slow, silent decline. #ThisIsMyTrophy #MaasaiGiraffe #EndangeredSpecies",477959,1602

There are nine leopard subspecies on Earth, occurring from the southern tip of South Africa's Cape mountains to the island of Java in Southeast Asia. The leopard can live in true deserts, tropical forests, and even in the Russian tundra, where it drops to below 10 degrees Celsius! The biggest threats facing leopards in Africa include the illegal skin trade, wire-snare poaching, and human-leopard conflict. This was shot while on assignment for @natgeo. Forests provide us with up to 50% of the oxygen we breathe, oceans the rest. Forest, grasslands, and mountains give us 75% of the freshwater.\nIf we can save the forest of the Amazon and other areas in Central and South America for the jaguar and puma the forests of Central Africa for the leopard, lion, cheetah, and elephants etc. and the forests of South Asia for the tigers and leopards—if you save the top predator in any ecosystem you save everything that lives with them.

With a hunting ban put in place in 2014, elephants have been mostly safe for the past five years in Botswana, and we have watched how stressed herds have relaxed and become less aggressive over the years. They need a lot of space, but they're constantly moving through the landscape, changing locations with the seasons, feeding as they go. However, a white paper handed to the Botswana government in late February 2019 has recommended a resumption in hunting, culling, and the closure of wildlife corridors. There are obviously issues that come with living with large numbers of these animals. However, in order to have an impact on the estimated 132,000 elephants, it would require killing very high numbers pf them, a move that not only will lead to a great deal of trauma in the remaining herds but likely hurt Botswana's lucrative tourism industry.

This is a massive algae bloom on Lake Erie, one of the five Great Lakes in North America. The boat in the frame, a small research vessel, is intended for scale—the sheer size of the bloom extends for miles upon miles outside the edges of this photo. These lakes collectively make up 84% of North America’s freshwater and 21% of the world's. Seeing pollution on this scale should have us all outraged at the sheer mismanagement of this precious resource. The Great Lakes have long been a place where chemicals, toxic pollutants, pesticides, and metals have been dumped from a large array of industry. These pollutants are flushed into tributary rivers that extend hundreds of miles throughout the Great Lakes Basin and then into the Mississippi River, which exits into the Gulf of Mexico, and the St. Lawrence River, which pours into the Atlantic. Even in small concentrations, many of these toxins have been linked to cancer, birth defects, and immune deficiencies. Although the pollution issue was much greater in the past, it’s still happening even today, and many of these toxins can take thousands of years to break down. The algae seen here is the product of excess phosphors in the water that cause these blooms when the temperatures increase. It’s not toxic to the touch, but if ingested, even through small droplets while swimming, water skiing, etc., it’s enough to make you sick. Illnesses and toxins can include dermatotoxins, hepatotoxins, neurotoxins, and cytotoxins. It’s a sad and serious issue.

In order to keep the genetic mix as wide as possible, the team sourced the lions from various reserves in South Africa and kept them all in a boma in KwaZulu Natal’s Mkhuze Game Reserve for three weeks to complete medical tests. Then they were sedated and put in two private planes for the journey to Mozambique.  Already, 20 cubs have been born since the lions’ release and it is estimated that that the population could grow to as many as 500 within 15 years.

Arctic permafrost is thawing much faster than expected, releasing carbon gases that could drastically speed up climate change. As a result, climate scientists—permafrost experts, in particular—say all signs point to the need for urgent and audacious action. In the far reaches of Siberia, a father and son are doing just that. Permafrost scientist Sergey Zimov and his son Nikita have created Pleistocene Park along the Kolyma river in the northeast of Siberia. The park operates as a nature reserve, research station, and large-scale scientific experiment. The Zimovs believe that they can slow down permafrost thaw by recreating the ecosystem of the Pleistocene era, which was dominated by grasslands and large, grazing animals that helped maintain and fertilize grass. Grasses absorb far less sunlight and heat than trees or tundra. \nTo test this theory, they have imported wild horses, like the ones seen here, as well other animals like bison, yaks, and moose. In 2018 the Zimovs joined forces with Harvard University geneticist George Church, who thinks he can clone a woolly mammoth. The hope is that one day those now extinct beasts will be stomping around Pleistocene Park.",477089,1224

After years of civil war in Mozambique, lions were all but lost in the Zambezi Delta region. Just a few decades ago, prides of lions once roamed the game-rich wetlands of the Zambezi Delta. But their numbers were decimated when their prey was overhunted during the drawn-out Mozambican civil wars, which raged from 1977 to 1992. Across Africa, a similar decline is occurring, with wild lion numbers dropping 42 percent in the last two decades, mostly as a result of habitat loss.

Bob was rescued by my cousin Odette, who works as a veterinarian on the island of Curaçao. Odette discovered that the flamingo developed an arthritic condition on both of his feet—one of the reasons he couldn't be released back to the wild as he simply wouldn't survive. She now uses the bird for education purposes within Fundashon Dier en Onderwijs Cariben @fdoccuracao, which is why we also had a x-ray made of his beautiful long neck in addition to his feet. With 19 vertebrae, flamingos actually have fewer neck vertebrae than many other long-necked birds. But having fewer vertebrae doesn’t necessarily mean that the neck is shorter the bones themselves are longer. They are seen  as a series of angles, rather than as a continuous smooth curve. This allows flamingos to bend their neck backward or downward to clean their feathers or search for food—its neck is vital to filtering food from water, as a flamingo often needs to turn its head upside down in the process.

My guides and trackers had already climbed a tree while I was still standing there taking a series of shots. I ran at the last moment, leaving the tripod behind. The rhino caught up fast. There was no time to climb the tree. I barely made it behind the tree when the rhino took out a branch as thick as my leg that was low to the ground. The trackers started barking like dogs, motivating the rhino to keep going. Thank God it did!

It was also severely bombed in the 1982 war with Israel. Having been largely closed to the public for 25 years, Horsh Beirut was finally reopened in late 2015, in what was considered a victory for civil society after demands for its reopening to all Lebanese citizens (prior to that, individuals had to apply for permission to enter and only had chances to get it if they were older than 35). Parks, green areas, and public spaces like Horsh are crucial assets to a city, offering a breathing space, reducing the pressure on the environment, and cleansing the city from the emitted toxic gases and polluters.

When it was mentioned to Harrison that scientists are skeptical about cupping and some of the other treatments he uses, he shrugged and said, “All I know is, before I get treated, I hurt, and after, I feel better.” Check out the story online or in print to see more pictures of James Harrison with cupping jars and acupuncture needles and to learn about Chinese medicine. #Cupping #Chinesemedicine #NFL #JamesHarrison #92 #FritzHoffmann",275472,5968

I plan to continue this project, capturing other threatened and endangered species, in the hope of creating awareness about the dangers of climate change and the effect of man on natural habitats.

Somehow this decline hasn't been at the forefront in the news, and we can just imagine how many other species are disappearing without any notice at all. Protecting habitat is more essential than ever as so many species will benefit from that blanket protection and security. From lions and elephants, right through to giraffes and the oxpecker birds feeding on the ticks in their hides, down to the dung beetles that replenish the earth with their droppings, we have an awful lot to lose if we leave this too late.  #maasaigiraffe #giraffesunset #timetoact",665262,2078
